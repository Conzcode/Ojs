# Tests to measure object recognition ability using jsPsych
The implemented tests do not save any data right now. You must add the code to save data dependent on the platform they are being used on (cognition.run, pavlovia, etc).
The stimuli are stored in a zip file in the releases and should be placed in the stimuli folder of each experiment that is being used.
